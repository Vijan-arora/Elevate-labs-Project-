# QuizApp – JavaFX Quiz Application

### A simple and interactive multiple-choice quiz application built using JavaFX.

This project is part of my Elevate Labs work, created to learn and implement JavaFX UI design, event-driven programming, and basic object-oriented concepts.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. User logs in with a username and password.
2. The quiz begins with **5 Java-related MCQs**.
3. For each question:
   - User selects one option.
   - Clicks **Next** to continue.
4. Timer runs in the background; when it reaches zero, the quiz auto-submits.
5. Final score is displayed with a **Retry** button.

## 📘 What I Learned

- Building layouts with JavaFX (`VBox`, `HBox`, `Scene`)
- Handling button actions and user input events
- Implementing countdown timers using `Timeline` and `KeyFrame`
- Managing UI screens dynamically through scene switching
- Applying OOP principles in GUI development (classes, objects, data modeling)

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Add more questions and categories
- Implement a high-score saving system
- Add external CSS styling for a modern UI
- Save quiz results to a file or database
- Add animations and UI transitions (fade, slide, etc.)
